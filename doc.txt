Data Cleaning:
Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., metadata columns).
Encode the target variable (e.g., ‘spam’ as 0 and ‘ham’ as 1).
Handle missing values and remove duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand dataset characteristics.
Visualize spam vs. non-spam distribution (e.g., pie chart).
Analyze character count, word count, and sentence count.

Text Preprocessing:
Remove special characters and symbols.
Convert text to lowercase.
Tokenize text into words.
Remove stop words (common words like ‘the,’ ‘and,’ etc.).
Apply stemming (e.g., Porter’s Stemming Algorithm) to reduce words to their base form.
Calculate word frequency and normalized term frequency.
